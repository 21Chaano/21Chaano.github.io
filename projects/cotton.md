Cotton is a horror-style text-based adventure game I developed using the functions and macros built from The Wizard's Game in [Conrad Barski's Land of Lisp](http://landoflisp.com/). Slightly more interesting and convoluted! (It is not that scary.)

#Intro and Rules

Huligutta is based on a board game from India of the same name. The objective is to corner all the tigers as the goat player or capture enough of the goats as the tiger player. Players take turns making moves. The types of moves depend on the phase of the game. In the beginning/placement phase, the goat player will place goats on the board. Goat player places a goat, tiger player moves one of their 3 tigers. Alternate and repeat until 15 goats have been placed. Once all 15 goats are placed, then begins the movement phase. In this phase, the goat player will move one of their goats to adjacent places on the board with the intent of cornering the tigers. Throughout the game, the tiger player is trying to capture goats. Tigers can only move to adjacent spaces, just like goats, but also has the ability to jump across a goat in the adjacent space if the next space in line with the tiger and goat is vacant.
