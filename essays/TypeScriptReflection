As a computer engineering student, I recognize that learning multiple different programming languages for my toolkit is a must. Assembly for operating systems, C for many hardware related cases, or Python for data science. Each language has its own use. 

As I am diving into the software side of computer engineering, It is important that I learn the skills from the languages that were designed for these new tasks and cases. One such language is TypeScript, an improved version of JavaScript that adds in features, namely the implementation of static typing.

## My Thoughts on TypeScript

As someone who is experiencing JavaScript and TypeScript for the first time, I do not think that I can say that I am fond of the language.

My first programming language was Python 3. After learning the fundamentals and basics of programming through Python, I then went on to further grasp the ideas of programming with Posix C and C++. 

If I were to compare JavaScript to those languages, I would say that JavaScript is like if Python tried to pretend to be C. Extending from that, I can see to a degree that TypeScript is to JavaScript what C++ is to C. As for my reason for not liking TypeScript as much as the other languages I know, I find it tedious that you could accidentally do things in TypeScript that your C compiler would scream at you for.

Other than this relatively minor gripe, the experience that I have had with the language so far is not at all negative. It has been convenient that the overall writing style and syntax is quite identical to the style of C. As I experience more and more of TypeScript, its uses, and its features, maybe my opinion will change.

## The Advantage of Athletic Software Engineering

One thing that is helping me learn more about TypeScript is the “athletic software engineering” approach to teaching that my ICS314 class implements. One method from athletic software engineering that is used is the Work-Out of the Day (WOD).

I personally think that this is a very interesting approach to teaching students how to code and solve problems. So far, the difficulty is fairly low for me and I am able to apply what I already know from having written programs in other languages, but now in a new language. It is good to help familiarize myself with all the quirks and details about TypeScript.

It is low-stress right now, but I do feel that as we go on, the complexity of the scenarios posed in the WODs will start to ramp up and really test my skills. This is a very fun and enjoyable approach to learning software engineering and I can not wait to see where it goes from here.

## Conclusion

All in all, I do realize that TypeScript is an important language to learn for software engineering, even if I do not like the language all that much myself.

Despite this, athletic software engineering has done a good job at making my process of learning this new language much more enjoyable. During the process of writing this technical essay, I did use a little bit of AI. The reason for its use was to help me define the terms TypeScript and athletic software engineering. The purpose of this was to make sure I was writing relevant details and that there would be minimal misunderstanding from my end.
