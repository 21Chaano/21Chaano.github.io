Depending on the person, asking a question can either be something trivial or a daunting task. As an introvert, I often hesitate to ask questions thinking that they might be “dumb” or maybe I can not think of a way to word it in a way to convey what I truly mean. While there is not a surefire solution to being confident in asking a question, there is a way to formulate questions so that others are more willing to answer and more likely to be able to help.


## What makes a question smart?

There is a good way and a bad way to ask questions. As per Eric Steven Raymond and Rick Moen’s guide [“How To Ask Questions The Smart Way”](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) there are multiple considerations to be made when formulating your questions. Such considerations include where you post your questions, the audience to which your question is addressed, the specificity of the details, and your effort to solve the problem.

Before the question is even asked, you should attempt to solve the problem yourself. If that does not work, then research would be the next step. You could check forums for other question posts that relate to your issue. If all else fails, then comes the time to ask your question. Asking a question on a website like StackOverflow is like sending an email. There is a subject, a body, and a location to send replies. The subject should be concise, yet should still give the necessary context. The body of the question post should include the issue itself and the steps taken to solve the problem.


## The good, the bad, the question

Here is an example of a [smart question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67941206/minecraft-forge-1-16-get-blockdamage-progress). The subject of the question briefly gives context to what issue the question is addressing. In this case, this question is about block damage in Minecraft Forge, more specifically version 1.16. As for the actual contents of the question, the questioner states the knowledge that they already have, and instead of asking for the answer straight out, the questioner asks for a nudge in the right direction. According to Raymond and Moen, asking for advice rather than information is more likely to give you some helpful answers than asking for a solution to your problem.

On the flip side, here is a [not-so-smart question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78981107/how-to-match-a-function-but-exclude-object-methods-without-negative-lookbehind). The subject for this question is the question itself. The questioner then explains that they are trying to figure out how to match functions together without matching an object method. They show the different cases that should and should not match. Even with all these details, the questioner leaves out crucial information such as the language and environment used. People who attempt to answer or provide assistance would put in more effort than normal and take precious time away from themselves.


## Conclusion

If you ever have a question about the issues that arise in your program, it is good practice to put in the time and effort to show that you are willing to learn rather than simply seeking the solution itself. It is as they say: “Help me help you”. By providing all the necessary information and the steps you have already taken, other people can more easily provide guidance and others who may have similar problems can follow your thought process to hopefully arrive at their solution.
