As a student studying computer engineering, it stands to reason that I must learn about software engineering. Software engineering is a major part of the application portion of computer science and engineering.

From telling the computer what to do, to creating websites for users across the world. There are many considerations to just what software engineering is capable of. During my time in taking ICS314 at University of Hawaii at Mānoa, I hope to learn the ins and outs of this discipline.

## What I Know

I must admit, I only know the basic definition of what software engineering is. To sum it up, software engineering is the practice of developing software through programming in order to solve problems. 

Software engineering is a major part of how OpenAI’s ChatGPT came into being. While I do prefer the hardware side of computer engineering, I understand that it is practically meaningless without the software. That said, the reverse is also true.

## What I Hope to Learn

My skills in programming are novice at best. While I did learn the basics and fundamentals of programming, I am not confident in my ability to solve more complex problems.

Sure I could write a function that converts temperature or write a sorting algorithm, but I really do not feel that I could comfortably and confidently say that I could create a massive project from scratch. In ICS314, I hope to take my coding skills to the next level. I want to be able to use the engineering process to solve complex problems and create a project of my own.
